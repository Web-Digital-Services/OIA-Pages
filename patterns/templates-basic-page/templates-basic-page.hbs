                <h1>Donor Private Policy</h1>
                <p>We have created this statement to demonstrate our firm commitment to your privacy. We do not collect
                    personally identifying information about you when you visit our site, unless you choose to provide
                    such information to us. Providing such information is strictly voluntary. This policy is your guide
                    to how we will handle information we learn about you from your visit to our Web site.</p>

                <h2 class="h4">Sharing of Donor Information</h2>
                <p>We respect the privacy of our donors and are committed to protecting your personal information. As
                    part of our donation process, basic donor information, including your name and address, may be
                    shared with key stakeholders, for the purpose of acknowledging your generous support. This
                    information will only be shared to the extent necessary for recognition and acknowledgment purposes,
                    and we ensure that all third parties adhere to privacy standards consistent with our own.</p>

                <p>We subscribe to the Donor Bill of Rights, which outlines the ethical principles and standards for
                    donor privacy and rights. You can read the full Donor Bill of Rights here.</p>

                <p>If you prefer that your information not be shared you can indicate this at the time of your donation
                    or you can contact us at give@uthscsa.edu, and we will accommodate your preferences.</p>

                <h2 class="h4">Use of Text and Images</h2>
                <p>If you would like to publish information that you find on our Web site, please send your request to
                    give@uthscsa.edu. Where text or images are posted on our site with the permission of the original
                    copyright holder, a copyright statement appears at the bottom of the page. Information about using
                    our logo and images is available in Media Resources.</p>

                <h2 class="h4">Accessibility</h2>
                <p>This Web site is designed to be accessible to visitors with disabilities, and to comply with federal
                    guidelines concerning accessibility. We welcome your comments. If you have suggestions on how to
                    make the site more accessible, please contact us at give@uthscsa.edu.</p>

                <h2 class="h4">Reading or Downloading</h2>
                <p>We collect and store only the following information about you: the name of the domain from which you
                    access the Internet (for example, aol.com, if you are connecting from an America Online account, or
                    princeton.edu if you are connecting from Princeton University's domain), the date and time you
                    access our site, and the Internet address of the Web site from which you linked to our site.</p>

                <p>We use the information we collect to measure the number of visitors to the different sections of our
                    site, and to help us make our site more useful to visitors.</p>

                <h2 class="h4">Online Profile Updates and Donations</h2>
                <p>If you complete the Profile update form and share your personally identifying information, this
                    information will be used only to provide you with more targeted content. We may use your contact
                    information to send further information about our organization or to contact you when necessary. You
                    may always opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the "Opt Out" section below.</p>

                <h2 class="h4">Sending us an Email</h2>
                <p>You also may decide to send us personally identifying information, for example, in an electronic mail
                    message containing a question or comment, or by filling out a Web form that provides us this
                    information. We use personally identifying information from email primarily to respond to your
                    requests. We may forward your email to other employees who are better able to answer you questions.
                    We may also use your email to contact you in the future about our programs that may be of interest.
                </p>

                <p>We want to be very clear: We will not obtain personally identifying information about you when you
                    visit our site, unless you choose to provide such information to us. Providing such information is
                    strictly voluntary. Except as might be required by law, we do not share any information we receive
                    with any outside parties.</p>

                <p>If you sign up for one of our email lists, we will only send you the kinds of information you have
                    requested. We won't share your name or email address with any outside parties.</p>

                <h2 class="h4">Kids and Privacy</h2>
                <p>For children who visit our site, special rules apply. We do not request personal information about
                    children, such as first and last name or street address and city. When kids send email to us, their
                    online contact information (email address) is not used to re-contact them and is not maintained in
                    retrievable form.</p>

                <h2 class="h4">Opt-Out or Change Your Contact Information</h2>
                <p>Our site provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us through a
                    special online form. You may choose to receive only specific communications or none at all. You may
                    also update your contact information previously provided to us through another online form. You can
                    not remove yourself from our database, but you can prevent unwanted communication.</p>
